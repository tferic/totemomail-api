# totemomail-api
The scripts in this repository are meant to demonstrate Totemomail's capabilities for automation using REST API.
These scripts are meant for Proof of Concept and are not intended to run in a productive environment.
As such, they could be used as a starting point to build own automation scripts.

Professional services for further customizations can be aquired through Belsoft Collaboration AG at
